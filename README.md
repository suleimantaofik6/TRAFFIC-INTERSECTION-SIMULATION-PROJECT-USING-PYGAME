# TRAFFIC-INTERSECTION-SIMULATION-PROJECT-USING-PYGAME
This project aims to simulate vehicle movement across a traffic intersection with traffic signals and timers for both vehicles and pedestrians. The intersection has four traffic lanes, each regulated by traffic signals with timers that show how much time the signal changes.
The file containing the main code is called Myproject.
Daniel Tweneboah ANYIMADU, and I have worked on this project to achieve our desired outcome.
For the code to run successfully, interested persons have to downolad the whole folder called Software Engineering as there are subfolders consisting of images that are well arranged according to the code.
